# GoodBank and Trust
 Final Capstone Project for MIT xPro

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repo and load it into your system
2. NPM Install - to inastall all dependencies
3. NPM Start - to run the app

### Further Improvements
From time to time the app crashes when depositing or withdrawing funds when logged into thw MongoDB client. I did not have time to fully dig into why this takes place, but the data is still saved upon logging back into the code. I also want to be able to add a google login button so there can be additional login functionality. Then obviously make it a bit more flashy. It is a fairly mundane UX so adding a bit more flare to the app could be fun.
